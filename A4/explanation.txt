What are the outputs for number of moves?
  When tested with an array of size 100, the following results I got were:
    1) Bubble Sorter
          Moves: 2441
    2) Merge Sorter
          Moves: 622
    3) Insertion Sorter
          Moves: 2499
    4) Selection Sorter
          Moves: 99
What are the outputs for runtime?
    1) Bubble Sorter
          Runtime: 346982 ns
    2) Merge Sorter
          Runtime: 69915 ns
    3) Insertion Sorter
          Runtime: 228935 ns
    4) Selection Sorter
          Runtime: 112641 ns
How do your results compare to your understanding of these algorithms?
  The results that I received make sense upon my understanding of these algorithms. I assumed that Bubble Sorter would be the least effective of the sorting algorithms, ad proved to be the least efficient. Selection Sort was more intuitive and used the least amount of moves, but ultimately was not the quickest.
If they are different, why do you think this is?
  I was surprised to see how quick the runtime for Merge Sort was, because it was quicker than Selection Sort, but still had more moves than the latter.
